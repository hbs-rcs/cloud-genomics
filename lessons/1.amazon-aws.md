## Launching and logging onto Amazon AWS

Objectives:

* Launch an Amazon AWS instance
* Identify the address of your cloud instance
* Log in to your cloud instance

### Launching an instance on Amazon Web Services

**Prerequisites**

* Form of payment (credit card)*
* Understanding of Amazon's billing and payment (See: [Getting started with AWS Billing and Cost Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-getting-started.html))

\* You can use some of Amazon Web Services for free, or see if you qualify for an AWS Grant (See: [https://aws.amazon.com/grants/](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/) ) if you are using AWS for education. The free level of service *will not* be sufficient for working with the amount of data we are using for our lessons.

#### Create an AWS account

1. Go to Amazon Web Services [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Follow the button to sign up for an account - you will need to agree to Amazon's terms and conditions and provide credit card information.


#### Sign into AWS and Launch an Instance
1. Sign into AWS EC2 Dashboard: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
2. Click the 'Launch Instance' button

3. In 'Step 1' you will be asked to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), on the lefthand side, look for 'Community AMIs' and then search for **ami-6516b30e**; select this image

4. For 'Choose and Instance Type' select **t2.medium**; then click 'Review and Launch'

    > **Tip:** You can select larger instances, but these will cost more to run. Also for the 'Review Instance Launch' you will get some warning about instance security. We will not go into detail here about security groups. However, you should know that when you launch an instance, you will want to take steps to make sure no one maliciously accesses your instance. For example, never give your security credentials (next step) to another user.
5. For the 'Review Instance Launch' step, click 'Launch'
6. You will be asked to Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair. Select 'Proceed without a key pair' and select the acknowledgement you are given. Then click 'Launch Instances'

You instance will now be launched. You should follow the links to 'Create billing alerts'.

#### Connect to Amazon Instance

**Instructions for MAC**

1. Log into your AWC EC2 Dashboard [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
2. You should see that you have one instance, to proceed the instance state must be 'running' (if you just launched the instance it will take <5 min for the instance to start running)
    ![](./images/logging-onto-cloud_5.png)
3. At the bottom of the dashboard, you should see a **Public DNS** which will look something like *ec2.12.2.45.678.compute-1.amazonaws.com*. Copy that address (you may wish make a note of it as you will need this each time you connect.
    ![](./images/logging-onto-cloud_6.png)
4. Open the terminal application on your Mac and use 'ssh' to connect. Your command will be:

   ```bash
$ ssh dcuser@your.amazon.dns
```
5. Your computer will be unable to verify the authenticity of the host... type **yes** to continue connecting
6. Then enter the password for this computer: 'data4Carp'

You should now be connected to your personal instance. You can confirm this with the following commands; ``whoami``,``pwd``,``ls``, which should yield the following results:

```bash
Last login: Thu Jul 30 13:21:08 2015 from 8.sub-70-197-200.myvzw.com
$ whoami
dcuser
$ pwd
/home/dcuser
$ ls
dc_sample_data	FastQC	Trimmomatic-0.32
$
```
**Instructions for PC**

1. Download the PuTTY application at: [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe)
1. Log into your AWC EC2 Dashboard [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
2. You should see that you have one instance, make sure instance state is 'running' (if you just launched the instance it will take <5 min for the instance to start running)
    ![](./images/logging-onto-cloud_5.png)
3. At the bottom of the dashboard, you should see a **Public DNS** which will look something like *ec2.12.2.45.678.compute-1.amazonaws.com*. Copy that address (you may wish make a note of it as you will need this each time you connect.
    ![](./images/logging-onto-cloud_6.png)
4. Start PuTTY. In the section 'Specify the destination you want to connect to' for 'Host Name (or IP address)' paste in the DNS address and click 'Open'
5. When prompted to login as, enter 'dcuser'; you may be notified that the authenticity of the host cannot be verified - if so, ignore the warning an continue connecting
6. When prompted for a password enter 'data4Carp'

You should now be connected to your personal instance. You can confirm this with the following commands; ``whoami``,``pwd``,``ls``, which should yield the following results:

```bash
Last login: Thu Jul 30 13:21:08 2015 from 8.sub-70-197-200.myvzw.com
$ whoami
dcuser
$ pwd
/home/dcuser
$ ls
dc_sample_data	FastQC	Trimmomatic-0.32
$
```

#**Very Important Warning - Avoid Unwanted Charges**
Please remember, for as long as this instance is running, you will be charged for your usage. You can see an estimate of the current charge from your AWS EC2 dashboard by clicking your name (Account name) on the upper right of the dashboard and selecting 'Billing & Cost Management'. **DO NOT FORGET TO TERMINATE YOUR INSTANCE WHEN YOU ARE DONE**

### Terminating your instance

When you are finished with your instance, you must terminate. Follow the following steps.

1. Sign into AWS and go to the EC2 Dashboard: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
2. Under 'Resources' select 'Running Instances'
3. Select the instance you wish to terminate, then click 'Actions'
    ![](./images/logging-onto-cloud_7.png)
4. Under 'Instance State' select terminate.

    > **Warning:** This will delete any data on this instance, so you must move any data you wish to save off the instance.

    >  **Tip:** You can use iCommands to move data between your computer, a cloud instance, and the iPlant Data Store. iCommands is installed on the Data Carpentry Amazon AMI. You can download and see documentation for iCommands [here](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+iCommands) - there is also some documentation on setting up iCommands in the Atmosphere section below
5. Select 'Yes, Terminate' to terminate the instance.
