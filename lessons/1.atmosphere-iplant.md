## Launching and logging onto iPlant Atmosphere


Objectives:

* Launch an Atmosphere instance
* Identify the address of your cloud instance
* Log in to your cloud instance


#### Connect to Atmosphere instance

**Instructions for MAC**

1. If necessary, log into your Atmosphere at: [http://atmo.iplantcollaborative.org/](http://atmo.iplantcollaborative.org/)
2. Verifying that your instance status is **'active'**, copy the IP address (e.g. 128.123.12.34) to your clipboard.

3. Open the terminal application on your Mac and use 'ssh' to connect. Your command will be:

    ```bash
$ ssh iplantusername@your.atmosphere.ipaddress
```
5. Your computer will be unable to verify the authenticity of the host... type **yes** to continue connecting
6. When prompted for a password, enter your iPlant username.

You should now be connected to your personal instance. You can confirm this with the following commands; ``whoami``,``pwd``, which should yield the following results:

```bash

#### Bringing sample data into your Atmosphere instance

The sample dataset is **NOT** included on the Atmosphere instance. The very first time you load the instance, you will need to copy data from the public iPlant Data Store into your instance using the following instructions.

## Setup iCommands

**Prerequisites**
* You must be connected to your Atmosphere instance

iCommands will allow you to quickly transfer data into your Atmosphere instance:

1. Initialize iCommands using the following command

    ```bash
$ iinit
```
2. You will then be asked to setup your account and will need to enter the following information

    |Prompt|Entry|
|------|-----|
|irodsHost|data.iplantcollaborative.org|
|port|1247|
|zone|iplant|
|irodsUserName|your iplant username|
|Current iRODS password|your iplant password|
3. Verify that you have connected to your iPlant Data Store; view the contents of your home directory using the following the ``ils`` command:

    ```bash
$ ils
```
## Copy Sample Data to your instance

1. Enter the following command:

    ```bash
$ iget -rPVT /iplant/home/shared/iplant_training/data_carpentry_ngs/dc_sampledata_lite .
```
2. using ``ls`` you should be able to verify you have downloaded the dc_sampledata_lite directories and files.


> **Tip**: You can use iCommands to move data between your computer, a cloud instance, and the iPlant Data Store. iCommands is installed on the Data Carpentry Amazon AMI. You can download and see documentation for iCommands [here](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+iCommands)

### Terminating your Atmosphere instance

When you are finished with your instance, you must terminate. Follow the following steps.

1. If necessary, sign into Atmosphere: [http://atmo.iplantcollaborative.org/](http://atmo.iplantcollaborative.org/)
2. Under 'My Instances' select the instance you wish to terminate and the click the black 'X' or find the 'Terminate' button and click.

    > **Warning:** This will delete any data on this instance, so you must move any data you wish to save off the instance (for example by using iCommands).
5. After reading the warning and confirming you are ready, click 'Terminate' to terminate the instance.
